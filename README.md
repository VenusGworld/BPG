# BPG
ðŸ”’ **BetterPasswordGenerator** allows, as the name suggests, generating passwords based on 5 criteria:

- Lowercase characters
- Uppercase characters
- Digits
- Special characters
- Size

It's important to note that the `string` module was not used for this generator.

## Dependencies:

The code is entirely written in __Python__.

Run the code with `py main.py`, it takes care of everything! =)
